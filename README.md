**Build modern and concurrent applications for Unix and Linux systems using Golang**

## What is this book about?
System software and applications are usually created using low level programming languages such as C/C++. Go is a modern language which combines simplicity, concurrency and performance which makes it a great candidate for building system applications. The book is a guide for building system applications for Linux and OS X using Golang.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Gain knowledge of Unix system programming 
* Understand and use Daemon Processes in dependency implementation 
* Explore and use the Go standard library to encode complex data structures 
* Gain insights into Golang internals 
* Master the Go concurrency model and its patterns 
* Become adept at implementing the Sync and Atomic Packages 
* Understand Go allocation and Memory allocation
